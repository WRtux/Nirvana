## Status

> The last modification of the source is on 2019-10-14.
> **The development of this game engine has been suspended for I'm studying for the College Entrance Examination.** Sorry.

> All the classes (include compile-failed and deprecated ones) has been moved to this public repository, but most of them don't have JavaDoc.

The engine's development was launched in August 2018, and the repository was moved to GitHub in September 2019. Thus, older versions of it are not uploaded.  
*Important changes* of the engine since 2019 are listed below.

### Latest version
* Separate `WindowElement` implementation from window control
* Rewrite the coordination control
* Add some JavaDoc for main logic (Chinese)

## Code

> Since the engine's basic functions are under development and could be rewritten anytime, build pass is not guaranteed.

A JavaME SDK is required to build or run the engine on desktop.
